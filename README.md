# AI-Related Data-Centric Backend Services Environment

This project provides a Docker Compose setup designed for backend developers focusing on AI-related, data-centric services. It's optimized for rapid prototyping of backend APIs without the need for UI components.

- `config/`: Configuration files for Nginx, PostgreSQL, and Redis services.
- `scripts/`: Contains scripts for database initialization or migrations.
- `src/`: Source code for the backend application, including the Dockerfile.

## Features

- **Docker Compose**: Simplifies the setup and running of multiple containerized services, including Nginx, Redis, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and a Node.js application.
- **Configurable Services**: Custom configuration files for key services to optimize performance and behavior according to project needs.
- **Rapid Prototyping**: Scripts and configurations designed to fast-track the setup and initialization of databases and services for rapid backend prototyping.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system.

### Initial Setup

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory.

   ```
   cd <project-directory>
   ```

3. Review and customize the service configuration files under `config/` as necessary for your development environment.

4. Customize the Node.js application Dockerfile in `src/app` as required for your backend service.

5. Use the `scripts/init_db.sh` script to initialize your databases with necessary schemas or data.

### Running the Environment

To launch all configured services:

```
docker-compose up -d
```

This command starts your services in detached mode. Use the following to view logs:

```
docker-compose logs -f
```

### Stopping the Environment

To stop all services and remove containers:

```
docker-compose down
```

## Customization

- Add or modify services in `docker-compose.yml` as needed for your project.
- Update environment variables and configuration files to fine-tune each service.
- Expand the `src/` directory with your project's backend application code.

## Security Considerations

- Update default credentials for services before moving to production.
- Secure your services with appropriate network rules and encryption.

## Troubleshooting

- If services fail to start, check the Docker Compose logs for specific error messages.
- Ensure that no port conflicts occur with the host or among services.

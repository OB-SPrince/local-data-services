**Component Name**: Dataset Metadata Management API

**Purpose**: To provide information about available datasets, what data they contain, and how to query them. This component will be accessed by other applications and may require manual configuration by a dataset administrator.

**API Design**:

- The API will be designed using REST principles.
- The API will support the following operations:
    - GET /datasets: Retrieve a list of all datasets.
    - GET /datasets/{id}: Retrieve a specific dataset by ID.
    - POST /datasets: Add a new dataset.
    - PUT /datasets/{id}: Update an existing dataset.
    - DELETE /datasets/{id}: Remove a dataset.

**Data Model**:

- Dataset:
    - id (unique identifier for the dataset, type: UUID)
    - name (name of the dataset, type: String)
    - description (brief description of the dataset, type: String)
    - source (URL or endpoint of the dataset, type: String)
    - fields (array of field names in the dataset, type: Array of Strings)
    - queryParameters (object containing possible query parameters, type: JSON)

**Storage Technology**:

- PostgreSQL will be used as the primary database for storing dataset metadata.
- Redis will be used for caching to improve the performance of the API.

**Security**:

- The API will implement authentication and authorization using JWT or API keys.

**Manual Configuration**:

- A separate admin API or a simple web interface will be provided for the dataset administrator to manually configure the available datasets.

**Documentation**:

- The API and data model will be thoroughly documented.

**Testing and CI/CD**:

- Unit tests and integration tests will be implemented.
- A CI/CD pipeline will be set up to automate testing and deployment.

**Error Handling and Logging**:

- Proper error handling and logging will be implemented.

**Rate Limiting**:

- Rate limiting will be implemented to prevent abuse of the API.

**Scalability**:

- The application will be designed to be scalable. This could involve using a load balancer to distribute traffic, implementing caching to reduce database load, or using a message queue to handle tasks asynchronously.

**Additional Requirements**:

- The component should be designed to be machine-friendly.
- The component should be able to handle requests from multiple applications simultaneously.
- The component should be designed to be robust and fault-tolerant.
- The component should be designed to be easy to maintain and extend.
